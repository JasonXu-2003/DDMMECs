## Overview
This repository contains the full source code, data, and supplementary
materials for **“Data-driven multimedia modeling of emerging contaminants in urban environments (Shenzhen, China)”**  
(Manuscript under review, *Environmental Science & Technology*).

Key features  
* Six-compartment mechanistic box model (air, water, soil, sediment,
  indoor dust, interior surfaces) written in **Python 3.11 / SciPy**.  
* **OSSE** (Observing-System Simulation Experiment) to generate synthetic
  calibration observations.  
* Screening-level ILCR computation for four demographic cohorts
  (children, teenagers, adult females, adult males).
