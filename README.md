## 1．Overview
This repository contains the full source code, data, and supplementary
materials for **“Multimedia Fate and Screening-Level Health Risk
Assessment of PFOA in a Coastal Megacity (Shenzhen, China)”**  
(Manuscript under review, *Environmental Science & Technology*).

Key features  
* Six-compartment mechanistic box model (air, water, soil, sediment,
  indoor dust, interior surfaces) written in **Python 3.11 / SciPy**.  
* **OSSE** (Observing-System Simulation Experiment) to generate synthetic
  calibration observations.  
* Hybrid calibration pipeline: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
  sensitivity scan → LSTM residual corrector.  
* Screening-level ILCR computation for four demographic cohorts
  (children, teenagers, adult females, adult males).  
* Reproducible Jupyter notebooks and all Supplementary Information
  (Text S1–S9, Tables S1–S9, Eq. S1).
